## Goal
Create a Windows and Linux web server in Azure to learn virtual machines, data and security.

## Azure Services Used
- Virtual Machines
- Installing webserver Linux and Windows
- Network Security Group
- Public IP
- Disk encryption 
- Disk snapshots

## Steps Summary
1. understanding VNets and subnets
2. deployed Windows Server VM and installed IIS
3. deployed Linux VM and installed Nginx
4. configured NSG rules for HTTP and SSH
5. tested web servers using browser

## Security
- only HTTP allowed publicly
- SSH key authentication used for Linux
- RDP access restricted by NSG

## What I Learned
- how NSGs control network traffic
- difference between public and private IP
- how Azure charges for running VMs
